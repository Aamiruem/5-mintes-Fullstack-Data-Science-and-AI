Here is the complete, beginner-to-advanced, interview-level guide to Python Classes and OOP concepts — explained clearly with examples.

✅ PYTHON CLASSES — COMPLETE GUIDE (Beginner → Advanced)
🔵 1. What is a Class?

A class is a blueprint/template for creating objects (instances).

class Student:
    pass

🔵 2. What is an Object?

An object is an instance of a class.

s1 = Student()
s2 = Student()

🔵 3. The __init__ Constructor

Runs automatically when an object is created.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

s = Student("Aamir", 21)


✔ self → refers to the current object
✔ attributes stored as self.name, self.age

🔵 4. Class Attributes vs Instance Attributes
✔ Instance Attribute

Different for each object.

class Car:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

✔ Class Attribute

Shared by ALL objects.

class Car:
    wheels = 4   # class attribute

🔵 5. Methods in Classes
✔ Instance Method

Works on object data.

class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("Car started")

✔ Class Method (uses @classmethod)

Works on class data.

class Car:
    wheels = 4

    @classmethod
    def change_wheels(cls, w):
        cls.wheels = w

✔ Static Method (uses @staticmethod)

Independent function inside class.

class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

🔵 6. Encapsulation (Hiding Data)
✔ Public
self.name

✔ Protected (_variable)
self._age = 20

✔ Private (__variable)
self.__salary = 50000


Private variables can be accessed using:

object._ClassName__variable

🔵 7. Getters and Setters
class Emp:
    def __init__(self, salary):
        self.__salary = salary

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, salary):
        if salary > 0:
            self.__salary = salary

🔵 8. Inheritance (Extending Classes)
✔ Single Inheritance
class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

✔ Multilevel Inheritance
class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(B): pass

✔ Multiple Inheritance
class A: pass
class B: pass
class C(A, B): pass

🔵 9. super() Keyword

Used to call parent class constructor or methods.

class A:
    def __init__(self):
        print("A constructor")

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("B constructor")

🔵 10. Method Overriding

Child class replaces parent method.

class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A show")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B show")

🔵 11. Polymorphism

Same method, different behavior.

for obj in [A(), B()]:
    obj.show()

🔵 12. Abstract Classes — abc Module
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass


Cannot create object of abstract class.

🔵 13. Dataclasses (Python 3.7+)

Auto-creates init, repr, eq, etc.

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    age: int

🔵 14. Magic/Dunder Methods

Special methods starting with __.

Method	Purpose
__init__	constructor
__str__	string representation
__len__	length
__add__	+ operator
__getitem__	indexing
__call__	make object callable

Example:

class Box:
    def __init__(self, volume):
        self.volume = volume

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.volume + other.volume

🔵 15. Composition (HAS-A Relationship)
class Engine:
    pass

class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()  # Car HAS a Engine

🔵 16. Class Documentation (__doc__)
class A:
    """This is class A"""

🔵 17. Nested Classes
class A:
    class B:
        pass

🔵 18. Private Methods
class A:
    def __secret(self):
        print("secret")

🔵 19. Property Decorator (Modern Getter/Setter)
class Student:
    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value

🔵 20. Singleton Class (Only 1 object allowed)
class Single:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

regarding interview questions and ans with proper explanation 
ChatGPT said:

Great! Here are TOP Python OOP/Class interview questions with answers + proper explanations (Beginner → Advanced).
These are the most asked questions in FAANG, product-based, and service-based interviews.

✅ PYTHON OOP & CLASSES — INTERVIEW Q&A (With Explanation)
🔵 1. What is a Class in Python?
✅ Answer:

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).

🧠 Explanation:

Just like a blueprint defines how a house looks, a class defines how objects behave.

class Student:
    pass

🔵 2. What is an Object?
✅ Answer:

An object is an instance of a class.

s = Student()

🧠 Explanation:

Object = real entity created from class.
Class = design, Object = actual product.

🔵 3. What is the __init__ method?
✅ Answer:

__init__ is a constructor that initializes object attributes.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

🧠 Explanation:

Runs automatically when object is created.

🔵 4. What is the difference between a Class Variable and Instance Variable?
✅ Answer:
Type	Stored where?	Shared?
Instance Variable	inside object	❌ No
Class Variable	inside class	✔ Yes (shared)
Example:
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # class variable
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # instance var

🔵 5. What is self in Python?
✅ Answer:

self refers to the current object.

🧠 Explanation:

Every object keeps its own data: self.name, self.age.

🔵 6. What is Inheritance?
✅ Answer:

Inheritance allows a class (child) to get features of another class (parent).

class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

🧠 Explanation:

Used for code reuse & building hierarchies.

🔵 7. Types of Inheritance in Python
✔ Single
✔ Multiple
✔ Multilevel
✔ Hierarchical
✔ Hybrid

Python supports all types.

🔵 8. What is Method Overriding?
✅ Answer:

When a child class redefines a method from parent.

class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

🧠 Explanation:

Used in polymorphism — different behavior for same method.

🔵 9. What is Polymorphism?
✅ Answer:

Same function name but different behavior.

Example:
for obj in [A(), B()]:
    obj.show()

🔵 10. What is super() used for?
✅ Answer:

super() is used to call parent class methods/constructor.

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

🧠 Explanation:

Used in inheritance to avoid duplicating code.

🔵 11. What is Encapsulation?
✅ Answer:

Encapsulation means hiding internal data using:

Public

Protected: _var

Private: __var

self.__salary = 50000

🔵 12. What are Getters and Setters?
Example:
class Emp:
    def get_salary(self):
        return self.__salary

    def set_salary(self, value):
        self.__salary = value

🧠 Explanation:

Used to control access to private variables.

🔵 13. What is an Abstract Class?

Uses ABC module.

Example:
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

Explanation:

Cannot create object of abstract class.
Used for defining structure.

🔵 14. What is a Static Method?
class A:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b


✔ No self
✔ Works like normal function inside class

🔵 15. What is a Class Method?
class A:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment(cls):
        cls.count += 1


✔ uses cls
✔ works on class variables

🔵 16. What is Multiple Inheritance?
Example:
class A: pass
class B: pass
class C(A, B): pass


Python supports it using MRO (Method Resolution Order).

🔵 17. What is MRO in Python?
✅ Answer:

MRO = Order in which Python searches for methods in multiple inheritance.

Check using:

print(C.mro())


Python uses C3 Linearization.

🔵 18. What is Operator Overloading?
Example:
class Box:
    def __init__(self, v):
        self.v = v

    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.v + other.v


✔ Allows +, -, *, == to work for objects.

🔵 19. What are Magic/Dunder Methods?

Examples:

__init__

__str__

__len__

__add__

__getitem__

__call__

Explanation:

These allow objects to behave like built-in types.

🔵 20. What is a Dataclass?
Example:
from dataclasses import dataclass
@dataclass
class Student:
    name: str
    age: int


Provides:

auto __init__

auto __repr__

auto __eq__

🔵 21. Difference between Composition & Inheritance?
✔ Inheritance (IS-A relationship)

Car is a Vehicle.

✔ Composition (HAS-A relationship)

Car has an Engine.

Example:
class Engine: pass
class Car:
    def __init__(self):
        self.engine = Engine()

🔵 22. What is a Singleton Class?

Allows only one object.

class Single:
    _inst = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._inst is None:
            cls._inst = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._inst

🔵 23. What is Duck Typing?

"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck."

class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane flying")


Both can be passed to a function expecting .fly().

🔵 24. What is difference between __str__ and __repr__?
__str__  → human readable  
__repr__ → developer/debug readable

🔵 25. Can Python have private constructors?

Yes using:

def __init__(self):
    raise Exception("Cannot create object")


or
Singleton pattern.

exception handling all concept explain
ChatGPT said:

Here is the complete, beginner → advanced guide to Python Exception Handling, explained in a clear, interview-friendly way with examples.
This covers ALL concepts you may need for interviews, coding rounds, and real-world development.

✅ PYTHON EXCEPTION HANDLING — FULL GUIDE (All Concepts)
🔵 1. What is an Exception?

An exception is an error that occurs at runtime and stops program execution.

Examples:

ZeroDivisionError

TypeError

IndexError

KeyError

FileNotFoundError

a = 10 / 0   # ZeroDivisionError

🔵 2. Why Use Exception Handling?

✔ Prevent program crash
✔ Show proper error messages
✔ Continue program execution
✔ Handle unexpected situations gracefully

🔵 3. try and except — Basic Structure
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

🔵 4. Catching Multiple Exceptions
Method 1 — Separate blocks
try:
    x = int("A")
except ValueError:
    print("Value error")
except TypeError:
    print("Type error")

Method 2 — Using a tuple
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
    print("Error occurred")

🔵 5. Generic Exception Handling
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except Exception as e:
    print("Error:", e)


✔ Exception catches all errors
✔ Good for logging, debugging

🔵 6. else Block in Exceptions

Runs only if no exception occurs.

try:
    print("No error")
except:
    print("Error")
else:
    print("Else block executed")

🔵 7. finally Block

Runs always, whether exception occurs or not.

Used for resource cleanup:

closing file

closing DB connection

try:
    f = open("test.txt")
except:
    print("Error opening file")
finally:
    print("File handling complete")

🔵 8. Raising Exceptions Manually (raise)
def check_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Age must be 18+")
    return "Valid age"

🔵 9. Custom User-Defined Exceptions
Step 1: Create class
class NegativeValueError(Exception):
    pass

Step 2: Use it
def set_price(p):
    if p < 0:
        raise NegativeValueError("Price cannot be negative")

🔵 10. Nested try-except
try:
    try:
        x = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Inner exception")
except Exception:
    print("Outer exception")

🔵 11. Exception Chaining (raise ... from)
try:
    int("abc")
except ValueError as e:
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to convert") from e


Useful for debugging, shows parent-child exception.

🔵 12. assert — Debugging Tool
x = -1
assert x >= 0, "Number must be positive"


If condition fails → AssertionError.

🔵 13. Logging Exceptions (Best Practice)
import logging

try:
    x = 10 / 0
except Exception as e:
    logging.error("Error occurred: %s", e)


Used in production applications.

🔵 14. Handling File Exceptions
try:
    f = open("abc.txt")
    data = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
finally:
    f.close()

🔵 15. Exception Handling with Loops
for i in range(5):
    try:
        print(10 / i)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero")

🔵 16. Multiple Except + One Finally
try:
    x = int(input("Enter number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Enter valid integer")
except Exception:
    print("Some other error")
finally:
    print("Always executed")

🔵 17. Avoiding Empty Exception Blocks (Bad Practice)

❌ Wrong:

try:
    x = 10 / 0
except:
    pass


✔ Hides bugs
✔ Hard to debug

🔵 18. Exception vs Error (Difference)
Exception	Error
Recoverable	Non-Recoverable
Can catch using try	Cannot be caught
Example: ValueError	Example: MemoryError
🔵 19. Built-in Exception Hierarchy (Important for Interviews)
BaseException
 ├── SystemExit
 ├── KeyboardInterrupt
 ├── Exception
     ├── ArithmeticError
     │     └── ZeroDivisionError
     ├── LookupError
     │     ├── IndexError
     │     └── KeyError
     ├── ValueError
     ├── TypeError
     ├── FileNotFoundError
     └── ...

🔵 20. Best Practices in Exception Handling

✔ Catch specific exceptions
✔ Use finally to close resources
✔ Never use empty except
✔ Raise exceptions when input invalid
✔ Log errors for debugging
✔ Keep exception messages clear

read write all file handling
ChatGPT said:

Here is the complete, beginner → advanced explanation of Python File Handling, including read/write modes, all functions, examples, best practices, and interview-level concepts.

✅ PYTHON FILE HANDLING — COMPLETE GUIDE

Python uses the built-in open() function to work with files.

🔵 1. Opening a File
file = open("data.txt", "r")

Syntax:
open(filename, mode)

🔵 2. File Modes (VERY IMPORTANT)
Mode	Meaning	use-case
r	read (file must exist)	reading
w	write (overwrites)	create new / replace
a	append	add data at end
x	create file (error if exists)	safe creation
r+	read + write (no overwrite)	update file
w+	write + read (overwrite)	recreate + read
a+	append + read	add & read
🔵 3. Reading a File
✔ read() — Read entire file
f = open("data.txt","r")
data = f.read()
print(data)
f.close()

✔ read(n) — Read n characters
f.read(5)

✔ readline() — Read one line
line = f.readline()

✔ readlines() — Read all lines into a list
lines = f.readlines()

🔵 4. Writing to File
✔ write()
f = open("data.txt","w")
f.write("Hello World")
f.close()


w overwrites file.

✔ writelines() — write list of lines
f.writelines(["Aamir\n", "Hussain\n", "Azad\n"])

🔵 5. Append to a File
f = open("data.txt","a")
f.write("New Line Added\n")
f.close()


✔ Does NOT overwrite
✔ Always adds at bottom

🔵 6. BEST PRACTICE — using with open()

No need to close file manually.

with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()


Python automatically closes the file.

🔵 7. Reading File Line by Line (Efficient)
Method 1
with open("data.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)

Method 2
while True:
    line = f.readline()
    if not line:
        break

🔵 8. File Pointer / tell() and seek()
✔ tell() — current position
pos = f.tell()

✔ seek() — move pointer
f.seek(0)  # move to beginning


Useful in large files and logs.

🔵 9. Working With Binary Files
Read binary
with open("image.jpg","rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

Write binary
with open("copy.jpg","wb") as f:
    f.write(data)


Binary = images, videos, PDF, MP3

🔵 10. Check If File Exists

Using os.path:

import os

if os.path.exists("data.txt"):
    print("File exists")

🔵 11. Delete a File
os.remove("data.txt")

🔵 12. Rename a File
os.rename("old.txt", "new.txt")

🔵 13. Exceptions in File Handling
try:
    f = open("abc.txt")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist")


Very important for interviews.

🔵 14. JSON File Read/Write
import json

data = {"name":"Aamir","age":21}

# Write JSON
with open("data.json","w") as f:
    json.dump(data,f)

# Read JSON
with open("data.json","r") as f:
    result = json.load(f)

🔵 15. CSV File Read/Write
import csv

# Write CSV
with open("emp.csv","w",newline="") as f:
    wr = csv.writer(f)
    wr.writerow(["Name","Age"])
    wr.writerow(["Aamir",21])

# Read CSV
with open("emp.csv") as f:
    rd = csv.reader(f)
    for row in rd:
        print(row)

🔵 16. File Handling Interview Questions (Quick List)
